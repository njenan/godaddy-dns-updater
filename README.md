# GoDaddy DNS Updater

This is a binary I wrote to keep my home Kubernetes cluster available.  Because I don't have a static IP, it will change occasionally, which means all the self-hosted software I run becomes unavailable outside my LAN.  I ru this script on a cron schedule to get my current IP and then call GoDaddy to update it.
